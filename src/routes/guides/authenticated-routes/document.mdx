Authenticated Routes
====================

When building apps with authentication, you'll often find that URLs need to behave differently depending on the details of the current user.

For example, say that you have a page that fetches a quote based on an id passed in via URL parameters.

```js
map({
  '/quote/:id': async request => {
    let quote = await fetchQuote(request.params.id)

    return createPage({
      title: resource.title,
      content: resource.content,
    })
  }
})
```

Assuming that all of your quotes are meant to be public, this site will work great! But imagine for a moment that the `fetchQuote()` function needs an auth token. If the current user isn't logged in, then you'll be unable to call `fetchQuote()` -- you'll need to display a login screen instead. And even if the user *is* logged in, you'll still need some way of knowing which auth token to pass to `fetchQuote()`.


Authentication State
--------------------

When you pass a function to `route()`, or to a path under `map()`, then that function will receive two arguments:

1. A [Request](/404) object
2. A configurable [Routing Context](../routing-context)

By storing the current authentication state on Navi's routing context, it becomes possibles to refer to the authentication state within your matchers. For example, you could create a route that checks for a `context.authToken` object, and if it doesn't exist, just renders a link to the login screen:

```js
//---
editorPathname: /resourceSwitch.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- pages.js <-- pages.js
//--- resourceSwitch.js <-- resourceSwitchWithLink.js
//--- helpers.js <-- helpers.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
```


Setting authentication state
----------------------------

<Doc.AsideTop>

In order to access the `currentUser` object through `context.currentUser`, you'll first need to add it to your routing context. The simplest way to do this is to pass a `context` prop to your [`<Router />`](../../reference/react/#router) element.

```js
<Router
  routes={routes}
  context={{
    currentUser,
  }}
})
```

<Doc.Details aside title="Context and Static/Server Rendering">

When performing static or server rendering, you'll need to imperatively set your routing context using [`navigation.setContext()`](/404)

</Doc.Details>
</Doc.AsideTop>

After adding some state to manage the value of `currentUser`, here's this will look like in practice:

```js
//---
editorPathname: /index.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- pages.js <-- pages.js
//--- resourceSwitch.js <-- resourceSwitchWithLink.js
//--- helpers.js <-- helpers.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
```

<Doc.Beware title="Context Caveat">

When the `context` prop changes as judged by a shallow equality check, your entire `Route` object needs to be recomputed, with all matcher functions being run from scratch.

I go into more details in the [Routing Context](../routing-context) guide.

</Doc.Beware>


Conditional redirects
---------------------

Creating and styling a login link for each of your pages can be burdensome. In many cases, a simpler solution is to redirect unauthenticated users directly to a login screen -- while still displaying the page's original content to authenticated users. You can implement this by passing a context-consuming function to `map()` -- here's an example:

```js
//---
editorPathname: /resourceSwitch.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- pages.js <-- pages.js
//--- resourceSwitch.js <-- resourceSwitchWithRedirects.js
//--- helpers.js <-- helpers.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
```

If you have many authenticated pages, you can create a helper that simplifies this even further by creating a `withAuthentication()` helper, like so:

```js
export function withAuthentication(matcher) {
  return map((request, context) =>
    context.currentUser
      ? matcher
      : redirect(
          '/login?redirectTo='+
          encodeURIComponent(request.mountpath+request.search)
        )
  )
}

map({
  '/account-details':
    withAuthentication(
      route({
        title: 'Account Details',
        getView: (request, context) =>
          <AccountInfo currentUser={context.currentUser} />
      })
    )
})
```


Bypassing the login screen
--------------------------

It often doesn't make sense for an authenticated user to be viewing a login screen. Luckily, conditional redirects make it possible to automatically redirect the user to wherever they were planning on going:

```js
//---
editorPathname: /pages.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- pages.js <-- pages.js
//--- resourceSwitch.js <-- resourceSwitchWithRedirects.js
//--- helpers.js <-- helpers.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
```


## Authentication and Static Rendering

When serving a statically rendered site, each page's HTML will be generated ahead of time. This has big benefits for performance and SEO, but it presents a problem when your app has authenticated routes: if your HTML is generated ahead of time, what HTML should you generate for authenticated routes? What about for routes whose content changes with the environment?

When building your app's HTML, Navi's rounting context defaults to an empty object `{}`. This means that using the redirect-to-login pattern discussed above, Navi will render authenticated routes as redirects to the login screen.

The default behavior of `navi-scripts` is to render each of your site's redirects as a HTML file with a `<meta http-equiv="redirect">` tag. This means that out of the box, your redirect-to-login routes will work, even with static rendering! Here's what happens:

-   When an unauthenticated user views an authenticated page, their browser will redirect to the login screen, just as expected.

-   When an authenticated user views a page, the user will initially be redirected to a login screen, but they'll then be automatically redirected back to the requested page via `history.replaceState()` once the app has loaded.

    <br />
    <Doc.Image src={require('./auth-redirect-flow.svg')} alt="Redirect flow diagram" />
    <br /><br />

While the default behavior works, there are a couple ways in which it can be improved. In particular, you can prevent the loading screen from being flashed to logged in users before they're redirected to the content.


### Delaying render until authentication

When an authenticated user is redirected to the login screen, there'll be a short delay between the page loading, and the user being redirected through to the page they requested. During this time, any statically rendered content for the login screen will be visible. As a result, authenticated users will see a brief flash of the login screen when they land on an authenticated URL.

This flash isn't usually a problem. It only occurs if the user lands directly on a protected page, and won't occur for subsequent navigation via `pushState()` within the same tab. Additionally, it won't occur at all if the user lands on a public page before moving to a private page. However, if you really want to make things as polished as possible, there's a simple solution: hide the login form until authentication has occurred.

There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest is to add an `isAuthenticationStateKnown` boolean to your Navi app's `context`, and set it to `true` once you've verified the user's identity, or decided that the user is a guest. You can then pass the value through to your login component's `props` to hide the login form until appropriate.

One thing to be careful of here is that [ReactDOM.hydrate()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate) can do funny things if the hydrated element doesn't exactly match the statically rendered element. Because of this, you'll always want to set `isAuthenticationStateKnown` to true *after* the initial render.


### HTTP redirects

By default, navi-scripts renders redirects as a HTML file with a `<meta>`-based redirect. While this default will usually get the job done, it does have the issue of not being able to forward the URL `?search` through to the target URL. As a result, to use `?search` parameters with authenticated pages, you'll need to set up HTTP redirects. For details, see the [HTTP redirects](../static-rendering/#http-redirects) section in the Static Rendering guide.
