## `<Link>`

This component can be used as a drop-in replacement for `<a>` tags. Internally, it renders an `<a>` tag so that statically rendered links will work even if JavaScript is disabled.

### Props

#### `active`: `boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

Allows you to explicit enable or disable the `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` props.

#### `activeClassName`: `string` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be added to your link's `className` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `activeStyle`: `object` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be merged into your link's `style` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `exact`: `bool` <small>(optional)</small>

If true, the link will only be considered to "match" the current URL if it is an *exact* match.

By default, a partial match at the beginning of the current URL will also be considered a match. This facilitates nav links, which often need to be highlighted when child pages are active.

#### `href`: `string` <small>(required)</small>

The url to navigate to; identical to the `href` attribute of a HTML `<a>` tag.

#### `prefetch`: `boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

If specified, the linked page's content will be fetched as soon as the link is rendered.


## `<NotFoundBoundary>`

You can wrap a `<NotFoundBoundary>` around a view to show a "not found" message when no route can be found to be rendered by the view.

### Props

#### `render: (error: NotFoundError) => React.Node`

### Example

```jsx
function Layout() {
  return (
    <NotFoundBoundary render={() =>
      <h1>Not Found</h1>
    }>
      <View />
    </NotFoundBoundary>
  )
}
```


## `<Router>`

Your app's `<Router>` component is responsible for subscribing to the latest navigation state, and passing that state to Navi's *other* components.

By default, `<Router>` creates a [`navigation`](../navigation) object internally, passing through the `routes`, `basename`, `context` and `history` props. However, if you'd like to define your `navigation` object manually -- i.e. for static or server rendering support -- then you can pass it in via the `navigation` prop.

### Props

#### `navigation`: [`Navigation`](../navigation/)

Your app's `Navigation` object, as returned from [`createBrowserNavigation()`](../navigation/#createbrowsernavigation) or [`createMemoryNavigation()`](../navigation/#creatememorynavigation)

By default, this will be created internally.

#### `basename`: `string` <small>(optional)</small>

The `basename` to use for the created `navigation` object. Only used when a `navigation` prop is not manually supplied.

#### `children`: `React.ReactNode` <small>(optional)</small>

If you don't pass in any children, then a [`<View>`](#view) will be rendered by default.

#### `context`: `Context` <small>(optional)</small>

The `<Router>` object will keep your `navigation` object's context in sync with this prop by calling it's [`setContext()`](../navigation/#navigationsetcontext) method.

This will be used even if you supply a `navigation` prop.

#### `hashScrollBehavior`: `'smooth' | 'auto'` <small>(optional)</small>

Specify whether to use native smooth scrolling using [window.scroll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scroll). By default, does not use smooth scrolling, as it is not supported by a number of browsers.

#### `history`: `History` <small>(optional)</small>

The `history` to use for the created `navigation` object. Only used when a `navigation` prop is not manually supplied.

#### `routes`: [`Matcher`](../matchers/)

The `routes` to use for the created `navigation` object. Only used when a `navigation` prop is not manually supplied.


## `<View>`

Renders the content for the next matched view that hasn't already been rendered.

If the content is a React element or component, then the `children` render function is optional, and that content will be rendered by default. Otherwise, you'll need to provide a child function to specify how to render the route content. 

### Suspense

When the page initially loads, it can be the case that *no* content is available -- even for previous routes. In this case, `<View>` will use React Suspense to pause execution until content is available. However, React requires you to wrap the suspended `<View>` with a [`<Suspense fallback>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense), so that you can decide what will be shown in place of the not-yet-ready content. If you've used [`React.lazy()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense), then this should be familiar -- otherwise, check out the example below.

As React doesn't yet support Suspense for server-side rendering, you'll want to avoid using `<Suspense>` for statically rendered apps. Instead, wait for Navi's initial content to render before calling `ReactDOMServer.render()` by creating a custom `navigation` object and using its [`navigation.getRoute()`](../navigation/#navigationgetroute) function, before passing the `navigation` object to your [`<Router>`](#router) component's `navigation` prop.

### Props

#### <code>children: (view, route) => React.ReactNode</code> <small>(optional)</small>

If provided, the component's `children` must be a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that receives the view's value as its first argument, and the current [Route](../data-types/#route) as its second.

If a `children` prop is not provided, the default behavior is to render the next unrendered view from `route.views`.

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

A `<View>` can be placed anywhere inside a `<Router>` component -- it doesn't have to be a direct descendent. You'll often want your `<View>` to be nested within a `<Suspense>` component, or a `<Layout>` component, like so:

```jsx
import { Router, View } from 'react-navi'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router navigation={navigation}>
    <Layout>
      <View />
    </Layout>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Usage with React Suspense

By wrapping your content in a React [`<Suspense>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) element, you can specify a fallback element to display while your app's initial content is loading.

Note that until `<Suspense>` gets server-rendering support, this only makes sense for apps that are *not* pre-rendered with `ReactDOMServer.render()`. For static or server rendered apps, use [`navigation.getRoute()`](../navigation/#navigationgetroute) to wait for the initial content to load before hydrating the pre-rendered HTML with `ReactDOM.hydrate()`.

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Router, View } from 'react-navi'
import Layout from './Layout'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes}>
    <Layout>
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        <View />
      </Suspense>
    </Layout>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```


## `useActive()`

```typescript
useActive(
  href: string | Partial<LocationObject>,
  options?: { exact?: boolean }
)
```

Returns `true` when the current route matches the specified href. You can use this along with [`useLinkProps()`](#uselinkprops) to create your own custom styled links.

### Examples

```js
// Will be true if currently at '/contacts'
let isViewingContactsIndex = useActive('/contacts')

// Will be true if viewing '/contacts' or any page nested within it
let isViewingContacts = useActive('/contacts', { exact: false })
```


## `useCurrentRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that allows you to access the latest non-busy [`Route`](../data-types/#route), which contains all information that Navi knows about the current page, including:

- `data`
- `title`
- `url`
- `views`
- etc.

*You can also access the result of `useCurrentRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<CurrentRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

You can use `useCurrentRoute()` to retrieve the current page's `title`, and display it as part of a `<Layout>` component.

```js
import { useCurrentRoute } from 'react-navi'

function Layout({ children }) {
  let route = useCurrentRoute()

  return (
    <div className="Layout">
      <h1>{route.title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `useLinkProps()`

```typescript
useLinkProps(options: {
  href: string | Partial<LocationObject>,
  onClick?: Function,
  prefetch?: boolean,
}): HTMLAnchorProps
```

This hook accepts a subset of the props that `<Link>` accepts, and returns an object with `href`, `onClick`, and any other props that you'd want to spread onto an `<a>`. You can then spread these props onto an `<a>` to make custom links components.

If the `href` is specified as a relative URL, it will be treated as relative to the current url. Navi normalizes the current URL so that trailing slashes have no effect.

Any unknown options will be passed through to the returned props object.

Use this along with [`useActive()`](#useactive) to create components that change their styles depending on the current URL.

### Examples

#### Navigation links with styled-components

Say that you've built a `<ListItem>` component with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/). You'd like to make the whole item behave as a link -- and you also want to highlight the item when the link points to the current page.

```js
//---
viewerURL: /hats
//--- index.js <-- styled-index.js
//--- layout.js <-- styled-layout.js
//--- list.js <-- styled-list.js
//--- routes.js <-- styled-routes.js
```

## `useLoadingRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that outputs the [`Route`](../data-types/#route) object for any page whose content is currently being fetched. If no page is currently being fetched, then it outputs `undefined`.

Use `useLoadingRoute()` to display a loading overlay when the user has requested a navigation that hasn't completed yet.

*You can also access the result of `useLoadingRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<LoadingRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

```js
import { useLoadingRoute } from 'react-navi'

function Layout({ children }) {
  let loadingRoute = useLoadingRoute()

  return (
    <div className="Layout">
      <BusyIndicator show={!!loadingRoute} />
      { children }
    </div>
  )
}
```


## `useNavigation()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns your app's [`navigation`](../navigation/) store, which can be used to facilitate [programmatic navigation](../../guides/programmatic-navigation).

*You can also access the result of `useNavigation()` by passing a child function to the `<NaviConsumer>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*


### Example

You can use `useNavigation()` to programmatically navigate after a form is successfully submitted.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useNavigation } from 'react-navi'

function EmailForm() {
  let navigation = useNavigation()
  let [email, setEmail] = useState()

  function handleSubmit() {
    navigation.navigate('/thanks')
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="EmailForm">
      <input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
      <button>Join 13,000 other subscribers</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```


## `useView()`

Similar to [`useViewElement()`](#useviewelement), this hook can act in place of the `<View />` element. However, instead of returning a ready-to-go-element, it returns an object with the view's raw `content`, a `connect()` function that you'll need to wrap it with, and an assortment of other bits and pieces.

```typescript
{
  chunks: Chunk[]
  connect: (node: React.ReactNode) => React.ReactElement<any>
  content: any
  element: React.ReactElement<any>
  final: boolean
  head: any
}
```

The main reason you'd want to use the `useView()` hooks is when your view content contains data that you need to manually convert to a React element. For example, here's how it's used in [create-react-blog](../../create-react-navi-app/#create-react-blog) to extract a `readingTime` variable from the view content:

```jsx
import { useCurrentRoute, useView } from 'react-navi'

function BlogPostLayout({ blogRoot }) {
  let { title, data, url } = useCurrentRoute()
  let { connect, content, head } = useView()
  let { MDXComponent, readingTime } = content

  // The content for posts is an MDX component, so we'll need
  // to use <MDXProvider> to ensure that links are rendered
  // with <Link>, and thus use pushState.
  return connect(
    <>
      {head}
      <article className={styles.container}>
        <ArticleMeta
          blogRoot={blogRoot}
          meta={data}
          title={title}
          url={url}
          readingTime={readingTime}
        />
        <MDXComponent />
      </article>
    </>,
  )
}
```

## `useViewElement()`

Returns an element that renders exactly the same content that a [`<View />`](#view) element would render *at the time that `useViewElement()` was called.*

```jsx
function App() {
  let view = useViewElement()

  return (
    <Layout>
      {view}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

Generally, this behaves exactly the same as rendering a `<View />`. The main use for `useViewElement()` is in implementing animated transitions between routes. In this case, you'll often need to render both the *current* view and the *previous* view at the same time. And while `<View />` will always render the current view, it's possilbe to store the `view` element returned by `useViewElement()` until it is no longer needed.

For example, here's an example of animated transitions using [react-spring](http://npmjs.com/package/react-spring) and `useViewElement()`:

```js
//---
//--- app.js <-- animated-app.js
//--- card.js <-- animated-card.js
//--- index.js <-- animated-index.js
//--- routes.js <-- animated-routes.js
```
